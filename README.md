# Next-express-turbo

This codebase leverages the powerful combination of Next.js and Express, seamlessly integrated through TurboRepo. Which, in turn, encapsulates the robust capabilities of Biome and TypeScript tooling, providing a streamlined and efficient development environment.

### What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following:

### Apps

- `client`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with appRouter `src` dir
- `server`: a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) app with `src` dir

### Tooling
- `biome`: `biome` configurations for format and lint all apps
- `typescript`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
